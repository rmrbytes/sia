### 7. Pre-requisites

This section covers the minimum requirements of the server and the API tokens to access models. 

### 8. Mastering .env

This section covers how to set the **embedding models**,  **inference models** and other settings to suit your needs.

### 9. Configuring inference servers

The role of the inference model in the success of a GenAI solution cannot be marginalized. Consequently, an understanding of how it works and what parameters should be tweaked to make the most of it is important to the success of such a solution. This section provides some guidelines and links to help you.
