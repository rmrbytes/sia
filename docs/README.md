## Overview

This gives an overview of Sia

### [1. Understanding Sia](01_understanding_sia.md)

This is an overview of what Sia does and how the different components interact with one another.

### 2. [Features - Current and Future](02_features.md)

This to give a peek into what current features have been introduced in Sia and those likely to be introduced in the short-run.

## Quick Start

This is to for folks who would like to *roll up their sleeves* and get the platform working using default settings.

### 3. [Servers' Installation](03_quick_servers_install.md)

This section covers how to install the servers of the Sia platform with minimum changes to the sample environment file. In a later section, there is a detailed help on how to customize the servers for your requirement.

### 4. [Admin CLI Installation](04_cli_installation.md)

This section is on how to download the CLI and use it to access the SIA servers set up in the earlier step.

### 4. [Set Admin Password](04_set_admin_password.md)

This section is on how to set up the **admin password** using  the command-line interface to set up the servers. Details on the CLI are covered in a later section.

### 5. Creating your first Agent

This section demonstrates the ease with which an agent can be created. It provides *sample data* to experiment with an agent.

## Administration

### 6. Mastering the CLI

The CLI is the only interface to administer Sia's servers; similar to how *git* and *docker* works. Master how short commands can power your servers.

### 6. Mastering the Agent configuration

This section covers all the **configuration settings** in creating a custom agent. It covers the supported chunking and query strategies in the *RAG pipeline*.

## Custom Setup

This is the most important set of sections to harness the full power of Sia..

### 7. Pre-requisites

This section covers the minimum requirements of the server and the API tokens to access models. 

### 8. Mastering .env

This section covers how to set the **embedding models**,  **inference models** and other settings to suit your needs.

### 9. Configuring inference servers

The role of the inference model in the success of a GenAI solution cannot be marginalized. Consequently, an understanding of how it works and what parameters should be tweaked to make the most of it is important to the success of such a solution. This section provides some guidelines and links to help you.

## Reporting Errors and Contributions

The platform is at a beta stage. Kindly use the [issues on github](https://github.com/rmrbytes/sia/issues) to post your queries, report bugs and requests for features. We will do our best to quicky address most of them.
